# Loch Sports Beta [ARCHIVED]

Welcome to the **Loch Sports Beta**, now live for iOS on [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/34j9sSJr)! üèà

Loch Sports is a unique blend of sports betting and fantasy sports, where instead of picking players, you're picking **bets**! Compete with friends in weekly matchups to see who can grow their bankroll the most.

## How It Works
- **Head-to-Head Matchups:** Each week, you‚Äôll compete with an opponent to see who can grow their bankroll by placing wagers.
- **Bankroll Credits:** Every player starts with a set bankroll of $100, which can be used to bet on various matchups.
- **Weekly Structure:** The game follows the same weekly schedule as traditional fantasy football, starting with **Thursday Night Football (TNF)** and ending with **Monday Night Football (MNF)**.
- **Simulated Bets:** All bets are simulated, with no real money involved. The game is all about strategy!
- **Betting Markets** Current options include straight bets on spreads, moneylines, and totals. Alternate lines and parlays will be integrated in future updates.

---

## Rules

- You must wager **AT LEAST $100** during the week; otherwise, the unused amount will be deducted from your final bankroll.
- Winnings can be reused to place additional bets.
- If your bankroll hits $0, you can no longer place bets for the week.

- **Regular Season:** Weeks 1‚Äì14
